## LogMyBlock - Minecraft Block Logging Mod
LogMyBlock is a server-side mod designed for server administrators who want to keep a detailed log of interactions with blocks in Minecraft. The mod tracks all player actions related to specific blocks, including interactions, right-clicks, the removal of items from chests, etc. Itâ€™s an essential tool for server management, especially in situations where monitoring player activity is crucial for preventing cheating or simply keeping track of block-related events.

### Commands:

**/logmyblock inspect**: Activates inspection mode. Right-clicking on a block will display its interaction history in the chat.

**/logmyblock lookup x y z page**: Retrieves the logs for a block at the specified coordinates (x, y, z) and displays the requested page of the interaction history.

**Note: The data is stored in the config folder of the server**
